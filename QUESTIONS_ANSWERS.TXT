I tried to override shelve to make it work with cloudpickle
When I code.interact and do it manually it works, but when I run diskt.py , it gives me 
error _pickle.PicklingError: Could not pickle object as excessively deep recursion required.

Would like to discuss tomorrow

Summary:
    #1 finished test_cases of functions and perdict class
            first writing test_cases really helped me to understand the class and the writing of the class
    #2 I commented out the __delattr__ because del perdict().some_val already works, does it necessary?
    #3 Since I wanted to use self.cache first, I loaded the dictionary only it is needed, which led to 
        write self.update() function and put the function in each function, not sure it is a good design?

    # Did not test yet

I removed close, was there a reason you wanted it? if you sync on setattr why do you need a close attribute, is there an edge case?

What's the difference between .cache and .dic? when you load .dic isn't that the cache?

implement eq, ne, and hash

did you do black, isort, and ruff?

clean up repo files, no junk
